# Building a Modern Portfolio Website with Next.js and Kubernetes

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk through how I built my portfolio website using Next.js and deployed it on a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS Lightsail. I'll cover everything from the initial setup to production deployment and monitoring.

## Why Next.js and Kubernetes?

When choosing the tech stack for my portfolio site, I had a few key requirements:

- **Performance**: Fast page loads and SEO optimization were crucial
- **Developer Experience**: Type safety and modern tooling were important
- **Scalability**: The infrastructure needed to handle traffic spikes
- **Cost-Effective**: AWS Lightsail offers great value for small projects

Next.js was the perfect frontend choice, offering:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Static site generation capabilities
- Great developer experience with TypeScript
- Built-in image optimization
- Fast page transitions

And Kubernetes (specifically k3s) provided:

- Container orchestration
- Easy scaling
- Self-healing capabilities
- Built-in load balancing
- Simple SSL/TLS management

## Project Structure

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:
